## SUMMARY
I am inspired in creating or improving useful and convenient web services in Finland. I am passionate about solving complex tasks that help people to make the activity and cognition of life savvier, clearer, and more productive.  
My interest in mathematics, deep focus, analytical and critical thinking, and the ability to communicate easily with people and to understand their needs put me in a meeting position between computers and the human world.  
Testing and user-oriented software are the areas that are of particular interest and importance to me. I am good at structuring information, constantly striving to improve my work, and paying attention to detail.   
I have 10 years of working with texts and people to better understand each other, as well as work experience in a large bank in Russia (Sberbank), the Finnish Central Association of Russian Speakers and Omnia's Communications and Marketing Department in Finland.
