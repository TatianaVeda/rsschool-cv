    <h2 class="section-title">SUMMARY</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
      <p>I am inspired in creating or improving useful and convenient web services in Finland. I am passionate about solving complex tasks that help people to make the activity and cognition of life savvier, clearer, and more productive.
</p>
      <p>My interest in mathematics, deep focus, analytical and critical thinking, and the ability to communicate easily with people and to understand their needs put me in a meeting position between computers and the human world.
Testing and user-oriented software are the areas that are of particular interest and importance to me. I am good at structuring information, constantly striving to improve my work, and paying attention to detail.
</p>
      <p>I have 10 years of working with texts and people to better understand each other, as well as work experience in a large bank in Russia (Sberbank), the Finnish Central Association of Russian Speakers and Omniaâ€™s Communications and Marketing Department in Finland.
